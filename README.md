# Mini-Games-
This project is written in java and consists of 3 mini games, each of which employ some aspect of object oriented programming and data structures.

The first mini game is a suitor game that consists of a public suitor class and a private suitor class, with methods that allow the user to create linked list of suitors and to choose a suitor out of the list, using a for loop. 

The second mini game consists of trying to escape a haunted house. The program creates a haunted house using a linked list (2 dimensional) and has a private room node for each of the rooms in the house. If-else logic is used to take user input to navigate through the haunted house. 

The third mini game allows users to take input from a file to run a sentiment anaylysis on the words included in the file. The program accomplishes this through the use of an FileInput stream to read input from the file being analyzed and to compare that input to a bank of positive and negative words from another file provided to the program. The program also includes exception handling for when it cannot find a file based on the name the user has inputted.
